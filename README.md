# MapQuest Midpoint Problem

Start a webserver in the root directory. One way to do it: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`.

The page should show two routes between Erie, CO and Boulder, CO. The circles are meant to represent the midpoint of each route. One of them looks right but the other one is way off.
Can you figure out why? Can you improve the code? Start by looking in `midpoint.js`.
